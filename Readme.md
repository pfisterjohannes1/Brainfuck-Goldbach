# Brainfuck Goldbach

The goal is to have a brainfuck program that only halts when the
 goldbach conjecture is wrong.


The script simplify.sh and convert.sh Convert goldbach.c to out.bf,
 a brainfuck program that only halts when goldbach conjecture is false.
Still in development, no output, generating code is not streamlined.
And code could be optimized.


The Brainfuck environment needs:
- Unlimited Cellsize
- About 20 or cells
